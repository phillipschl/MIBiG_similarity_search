# Similarity search against the MIBiG database

This repo is a tool to search for similar secondary metabolites against the [MIBiG (Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster)](https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/) database. The tool calculates the [MAP4](https://github.com/reymond-group/map4) molecular fingerprint from a SMILES string of a given input molecule and calculates the Jaccard distance to molecules found in the MIBiG database.
To use the code immediatly use jupyter notebook implemented in binder by clicking the badget below.
